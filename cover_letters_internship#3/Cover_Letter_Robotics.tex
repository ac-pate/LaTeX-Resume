\textbf{Re: Application for Internship / Co-op Position}

\vspace{0.2in}

To the Hiring Team,

For the first two years of my engineering degree, I was certain I wanted to manufacture chips. That changed during the 2025 Canadian Engineering Competition, where my team won the National Championship not by following the standard procedure, but by rejecting the expected approach entirely and building an out-of-the-box solution that solved the problem in seconds rather than minutes. That moment clarified my ambition: I don’t want to just manufacture the silicon; I want to be the engineer pushing that silicon to its absolute limits to build intelligent, embodied machines. I am applying to [Company Name] because your work represents the exact kind of high-stakes, high-impact engineering that drove me to pivot fully into robotics.

I bring a blend of rigorous low-level understanding and high-level autonomy experience. During my internship at CUARL, I architected ROS2 teleoperation pipelines and perception systems for an articulated rover, moving from open-loop control to closing the loop with visual feedback on hardware. I am currently co-leading the MIMIC Capstone, integrating VLA models (such as $\pi_0$ and ACT) on bimanual mobile manipulators for imitation learning research. Whether it is validating 800G Ethernet PHYs at Microchip or designing custom transformers for RNA folding predictions, I build systems that work in the real world, not just in simulation. I am eager to bring this intensity and technical breadth to your team this summer.
