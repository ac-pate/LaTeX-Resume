To Whom It May Concern,
\vspace{0.2in}

After participating in my first robotics competition and going on to win the 2025 Canadian Engineering Competition as National Champions, I realized it was all-in on robotics or nothing. My childhood dream was always space, and when I landed a research internship at CUARL (Concordia University Aerospace Robotics Lab) working on articulated rovers, it felt like that dream coming true. Since then, I have completed projects spanning autonomous systems, bimanual manipulation, and sensor fusion, and I am currently co-leading the MIMIC Capstone with McGill's Mobile Robotics Lab, building bimanual mobile robots that learn from human demonstration using VLA models and imitation learning. My passion lies in robotics—whether aerospace, autonomous, or mobile manipulation—using sensor data to solve real, unforgiving engineering challenges. I am applying to \companyname\ because your work embodies exactly that philosophy.
\vspace{0.2in}

I bring deep technical expertise across the robotics stack. I have built ROS2 teleoperation and MoveIt2 pipelines, developed perception systems with ZED cameras on Jetson hardware, and integrated ros2\_control with CAN bus motor drivers for real-time closed-loop control. My experience spans Gazebo simulation, Isaac Sim, and deploying VLA models ($\pi_0$, ACT) on physical hardware. On the low level, I have designed controllers, programmed embedded systems, and worked with FPGAs for hardware acceleration. Beyond technical skills, I am a CEC National Champion, former VP of Projects at IEEE Concordia (leading IoT, drone, and robotic arm projects), and I have delivered workshops on robotics and microcontrollers. I bring a relentless work ethic, a portfolio of deployed systems, and the ability to execute from concept to hardware. I would be an asset to your team this summer.
