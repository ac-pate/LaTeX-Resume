# User Profile Summary for AI Context

## Identity & Core Narrative
**Name:** Achal Patel  
**Role:** Computer Engineering Student (Co-op) @ Concordia University  
**Origin Story:** "The Pivot"
- Originally aimed for Chip Manufacturing/Semiconductors.
- Turning point: **The 2025 Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC)**.
- **Key Event:** Won National Championship by rejecting the standard solution and building an "out-of-the-box" solution that solved the task in 2.6 seconds (vs. organizers' 1 minute).
- **Philosophy:** "I don't simply want to make the chips; I want to be the one pushing them to their limits to build intelligent machines."
- **Current Focus:** Unapologetically Robotics, Embodied AI, and Intelligent Systems.

## Technical Pillars
1.  **Robotics & Autonomy**
    - **Key Tech:** ROS2 (Control, CanOpen), MoveIt2, Gazebo, Navigation2.
    - **Hardware:** Jetson (AGX/Orin), ZED Stereo Cameras, RealSense, CAN Bus, Manipulators (Kinova/SO-100).
    - **Experience:** 
        - **CUARL:** Articulated wheel-legged rover, teleoperation, closed-loop perception.
        - **MIMIC Capstone:** Bimanual manipulation, VLA models, Imitation Learning (LeRobot).

2.  **Machine Learning & AI**
    - **Focus:** Practical, deployed AI (not just theoretical).
    - **Key Project:** **RNA Folding Kaggle Win**. Beat PhD/Master's students using a custom Transformer/DeepResUNetSE hybrid architecture.
    - **Current Interests:** VLA Models ($\pi_0$, ACT), World Models, Embodied AI.
    - **Stack:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, OpenCV, YOLO.

3.  **Embedded Systems & Hardware Validation**
    - **Experience:** **Microchip Internship**. Validated 800G Ethernet PHYs, 112G PAM4 SerDes.
    - **Training:** NASA HPSC (High-Performance Spaceflight Computing) architecture.
    - **Skills:** SystemVerilog, VHDL, FPGA, C/C++, RTOS, Pytest for hardware validation.

## Leadership & Soft Skills
- **VP Projects (IEEE):** Managed $11k+ funding, led multidisciplinary teams (FPGA CPU, IoT Lab, Drones).
- **Teaching:** Instructor for Robotics/3D Printing workshops; TA for Hardware/FPGA courses.
- **Competitions:** National Champion (CEC), QEC 2nd Place, Englympic Winner.

## Tone & Style for Applications
- **Confident & Direct:** "I apply because the job looked out for me."
- **Pragmatic:** "Code that moves the world, not just data."
- **No Fluff:** Technical, precise, driven by results (e.g., "solved in 2.6s").
- **Constraint:** Always strictly 1 page, concise, "Charter" font style (Latex).

## Key Themes for Future Cover Letters
- **Robotics:** Emphasize the "Pivot," CEC win, and full-stack hardware-to-autonomy skills.
- **ML/AI:** Emphasize the architecture design (RNA Folding) and VLA/Imitation Learning.
- **SWE/Embedded:** Emphasize reliability, validation (Microchip), and "mission-critical" mindset.
